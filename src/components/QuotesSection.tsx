    "Mindset is the mother of every vision. Every great idea is conceived in your mind, so take care of it.",
    "My chalk writes lessons, but my life writes legacies.",
    "I don't just raise grades I raise giants who raise others.",
    "Mentorship is my rebellion against the silence I grew up in.",

    "The goal is not to be remembered as a teacher, but as the voice that awakened something sacred in them.",

    "Teaching fills the mind. Mentorship shapes the soul.",
    "They may forget the formulas I teach, but they'll never forget the fire I helped them find.",
